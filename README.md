# Sara Kaplan Portfolio Site

This is a website for visual artist Sara Kaplan. The project was built with GatsbyJS, and deployed on the Netlify CDN. It also uses the Netlify CMS for content management and Netlify forms to contact Sara. 

The website also contains a a GraphQL API that dynamically publishes the latest content from Sara's Instagram, [@saraellenkaplan](https://instagram.com/saraellenkaplan). The Instagram API acts as a secondary "CMS" for Sara to update the content on the website with zero effort whenever she posts to Instagram. 

The domain name for the website is [sarakaplan.netlify.app](https://sarakaplan.netlify.app) at time of writing, although it will eventually be transferred to the domain [sarakaplan.net](https://sarakaplan.net). Currently there is an other prototype of the site at this domain, and the domain transfer has presented some logistical challenges (human not technical). 

This website was created based on the [Gatsby starter template Foundation](https://github.com/stackrole/gatsby-starter-foundation).
